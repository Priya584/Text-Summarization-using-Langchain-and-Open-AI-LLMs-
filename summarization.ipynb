       "'A Foundation for Health Care Reform Legislation\\nMAyo CLiniC’s Point oF View      \\nMayo Clinic believes that U.s. health care urgently needs reform to ensure access to quality, \\naffordable patient care. each major stakeholder — doctors/hospitals, patients, payers and the government — plays a key role in reform. w ith reform now in the hands of lawmakers, \\nit’s important to outline the specific responsibilities that our elected officials have in helping to build a health care system that works for all Americans.\\nGoal\\nHigh-quality, affordable health care for all.\\n  \\nGovernment’s Role in Achieving the Goal\\nReform the Medicare payment system to create incentives for caregivers to offer the \\uf0a7\\t\\nhighest quality care at the most reasonable cost.\\nCoordinate basic, private insurance offerings and provide sliding-scale subsidies to \\uf0a7\\t\\nenable all Americans to purchase health insurance.\\nProcess\\nLegislation must address both issues — payment reform and insurance — simultaneously. \\nThis is the opportunity to begin a transformation toward a health care system that delivers and \\npays for what we really want — high quality, affordable care for patients. \\nProviding insurance without addressing underlying payment issues and care delivery will \\ncreate significant unintended consequences — for example, restricted access for Medicare \\npatients and early bankruptcy of this entitlement program. Historically, across-the-board \\npayment cuts have not improved health care quality and have resulted in higher cost due to increased volumes of services provided to make up for lost revenues. We must identify novel approaches to accomplish these goals. \\nDetailed Recommendations — Payment Reform\\nLegislators must focus on creating new ways to provide fair payment to doctors and hospitals \\nthat offer high-quality, lower-cost care. The Medicare program is the lever that Congress can \\nuse to start us along this path. \\nWe believe that Congress should set a three-year deadline for creating and implementing new \\nMedicare payment methods. Congress must send the message to providers that they need to \\nstart now to re-engineer the care delivery models to create better value for patients, coordinate care and improve quality at a lower cost. Some ideas to move toward paying for high-quality, affordable care include:\\n1. Medicare value indexing\\nEmbed a “value index” into Medicare Parts A and B to reward those who provide safe, \\nhigh-quality care with excellent service at a reasonable cost, and to provide the incentive \\nfor other providers to provide care that is of higher quality and lower cost.  \\nFor example, a value index could be defined by the equation Value equals Quality over \\nCost or V=Q/C.  \\nQuality (Q) — the numerator — includes clinical outcomes, safety and patient-1. \\nreported satisfaction. \\nExamples of outcome measures: hospital admissions, emergency department \\uf0a7\\t\\nvisits, readmission rates and mortality rates Examples of safety measures: central line infection rates, medication errors \\uf0a7\\t\\nand post-operative complicationsExamples of patient satisfaction: National Research Corporation’s \\uf0a7\\t Healthcare \\nMarket Guide\\nPerformance measurement information is currently available through a variety of respected sources, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Quality Foundation, Leap Frog, AQA, University HealthSystem Consortium, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, and the Commonwealth Fund.  \\nCost (C) — the denominator — encompasses the cost of care 2. over time. Regional \\nMedicare spending data from Medicare itself or from the Dartmouth Atlas of \\nHealthcare could provide the information necessary to round out the equation.\\nProviders would then experience payment repercussions based upon their value scores. Over time, we believe that providers would change their behaviors — sharing information, eliminating unnecessary tests — in order to increase quality and decrease costs because payment would be affected by it. \\nThe value index can be constructed for many types of payment models, including hospital \\nDRG payments, physician fees, payment updates and other payment formulas, including bundled payments. \\n2. Bundled payments for high-cost conditions, such as total knee replacement, heart \\nattack and lumbar disc herniation\\nTo realize cost savings quickly, Medicare should start with bundled payments for a limited \\nnumber of high-cost hospital episodes. (Over time, bundled payments could be considered for some chronic conditions as well.) The goal is to reduce practice variation and focus on an outcome-based goal.  \\nThe bundled payment might include hospitalization (Part A), physician (Part B) and post-\\nacute care (nursing home, home health care, etc.) services.  The outcome would be defined as reasonably attainable improvement in health status in the safest, most cost-effective way and would cover the entire episode of care through the patient’s return to function.   \\nSuch a reformed payment model would encourage improved coordination of care among \\nphysicians, hospitals and nursing homes, and it would encourage utilization of nursing and other non-physician caregivers.  It would be important to allow providers time to \\nprepare for this method of reimbursement because many don’t currently participate in organized delivery systems.\\n3. Value-based care demonstration project\\nA longer term recommendation is to develop and implement national value-based care \\ndemonstration projects. These pilots will help us determine which organizational structures and payment methods will drive quality, affordable care. \\nDetailed Recommendations – Insurance for All\\nThe current private health insurance system must be reformed. We agree with the direction of \\nthe following proposal from Len Nichols and John Bertko of the New America Foundation:\\nRequire Americans to purchase health insurance\\uf0a7\\t\\nProvide sliding-scale subsidies to help those in need to buy the insurance\\uf0a7\\t\\nProhibit pre-existing condition exclusions\\uf0a7\\t\\nDefine a minimum health benefit package or actuarial equivalent\\uf0a7\\t\\nAdjust risk-levels among enrollees\\uf0a7\\t\\nWithin the context of a reformed insurance system, we recommend that the government create a simple coordinating mechanism for individuals to select a basic private insurance plan from several options — perhaps modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP).  Let’s give the American people the same insurance options that members of Congress enjoy. We do not support the creation of another government-run, government price-controlled, Medicare-like insurance plan. Medicare pays for volume, not value, causes significant cost-shifts to the private sector and is financially unsustainable. \\nOperational Framework\\nTo carry out some of these functions, we may need to move them a step away from the direct \\ninfluence of lobbyists and special interests. We recommend that Congress clearly delegate \\nresponsibility and authority to establish new methods of Medicare payment to either the \\nSecretary for Health and Human Services (who could form an advisory board, if desired) or a \\nquasi-independent commission.

Lawmakers must propose and pass bold, innovative legislation in order to accomplish this. \\nAddendum: Pay-for-Value Approaches \\nShared Savings\\n•\\t .  For high-cost patients (such as patients hospitalized for diabetic-related \\ncomplications), determine the annual cost per patient for each separate provider system.   \\nThe payer would share this information with each provider system and offer to share savings in total cost per patient with each provider system that can deliver such savings while maintaining or improving patient outcomes. \\nChronic Condition(s) Coordination Payments\\n•\\t .  Under this approach, patients with one \\nor more chronic conditions would choose a “medical home” (place with resources and \\ninfrastructure to organize and coordinate care over time) for their care management, preventive care and minor care associated with those chronic conditions.  The medical home would receive a periodic, prospectively-defined “care management payment” to cover those services.  Acute patient care episodes would be paid separately under regular insurance coverage rules. \\nVaried Provider Payment Updates\\n•\\t .  This approach would expand the concept used by the \\nCMS-Premier Hospital Quality Demonstration Project.  For the hospital-based episodes of \\ncare (hospitalized patients account for the majority of health care expense), use risk-adjusted patient outcome measures (mortality, safety, patient satisfaction) and cost over a span of time (such as the Dartmouth Atlas cost in the last six months of life) to determine which care systems are delivering the best value.  Providers delivering the best value would receive a larger payment update.   \\nFull Capitation\\n•\\t .  Some large, integrated providers can accept full capitation for a defined \\nbenefit set for an enrolled population.  This is an excellent way to encourage provider \\nefficiency.  Shared-risk agreements can be created for groups of various sizes, including smaller groups.  It will be important, and possible, to develop capitation approaches that take into consideration the lessons learned from the failures of capitation in the 1990s. \\nShared Decision-Making•\\t .  Under this approach, all patient candidates with selected conditions \\nthat include preference-based elective surgery and other treatment choices (for example, spinal \\nfusion, PSAs, etc.) would be offered an approved decision aid based on their disease/condition and its treatment options.  Medical centers would be compensated for offering the \\nindependent educational program.  It may be appropriate to create incentives for payers to offer these programs and for patients to complete them. \\nAccountable Care Organizations\\n•\\t . Under this approach, a group of physicians (and possibly \\na hospital) could be responsible for quality and overall annual Medicare spending for their \\npatients.  Different payment models could be tested.  For example, physicians would be \\npaid FFS rates, less a withhold, and then receive bonuses for meeting resources use and \\nquality targets over the course of a year. Options might include creating virtual accountable care organizations based on physician-hospital referral relationships.  Such an approach would create incentives for physicians and hospitals to work together to provide better value care. \\nEpisode-Based Payments for Hospitalized Patients\\n•\\t .  This approach would provide a single \\nbundled payment to hospitals and physicians managing the care for patients with major \\nacute episodes.  One lump payment for both hospital and physician services is different from the present Medicare DRG payment that only covers the hospital service.  The new approach is intended to encourage the two groups (hospital and treating physicians) to \\neffectively integrate patient care.  \\nThe idea of “episode-based payments for hospitalized patients” is to concentrate efforts \\nwhere the dollars are and not get bogged down trying to change payment approaches for all medical services.  This is especially pertinent since 10-15% of patients will account for 80% of total costs.'"

       "[Document(page_content='A Foundation for Health Care Reform Legislation\\nMAyo CLiniC’s Point oF View      \\nMayo Clinic believes that U.s. health care urgently needs reform to ensure access to quality, \\naffordable patient care. each major stakeholder — doctors/hospitals, patients, payers and the government — plays a key role in reform. w ith reform now in the hands of lawmakers, \\nit’s important to outline the specific responsibilities that our elected officials have in helping to build a health care system that works for all Americans.\\nGoal\\nHigh-quality, affordable health care for all.\\n  \\nGovernment’s Role in Achieving the Goal\\nReform the Medicare payment system to create incentives for caregivers to offer the \\uf0a7\\t\\nhighest quality care at the most reasonable cost.\\nCoordinate basic, private insurance offerings and provide sliding-scale subsidies to \\uf0a7\\t\\nenable all Americans to purchase health insurance.\\nProcess\\nLegislation must address both issues — payment reform and insurance — simultaneously. \\nThis is the opportunity to begin a transformation toward a health care system that delivers and \\npays for what we really want — high quality, affordable care for patients. \\nProviding insurance without addressing underlying payment issues and care delivery will \\ncreate significant unintended consequences — for example, restricted access for Medicare \\npatients and early bankruptcy of this entitlement program. Historically, across-the-board \\npayment cuts have not improved health care quality and have resulted in higher cost due to increased volumes of services provided to make up for lost revenues. We must identify novel approaches to accomplish these goals. \\nDetailed Recommendations — Payment Reform\\nLegislators must focus on creating new ways to provide fair payment to doctors and hospitals \\nthat offer high-quality, lower-cost care. The Medicare program is the lever that Congress can \\nuse to start us along this path. \\nWe believe that Congress should set a three-year deadline for creating and implementing new \\nMedicare payment methods. Congress must send the message to providers that they need to \\nstart now to re-engineer the care delivery models to create better value for patients, coordinate care and improve quality at a lower cost. Some ideas to move toward paying for high-quality, affordable care include:\\n1. Medicare value indexing\\nEmbed a “value index” into Medicare Parts A and B to reward those who provide safe, \\nhigh-quality care with excellent service at a reasonable cost, and to provide the incentive \\nfor other providers to provide care that is of higher quality and lower cost.  \\nFor example, a value index could be defined by the equation Value equals Quality over \\nCost or V=Q/C.  \\nQuality (Q) — the numerator — includes clinical outcomes, safety and patient-1. \\nreported satisfaction. \\nExamples of outcome measures: hospital admissions, emergency department \\uf0a7\\t\\nvisits, readmission rates and mortality rates Examples of safety measures: central line infection rates, medication errors \\uf0a7\\t\\nand post-operative complicationsExamples of patient satisfaction: National Research Corporation’s \\uf0a7\\t Healthcare \\nMarket Guide\\nPerformance measurement information is currently available through a variety of respected sources, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Quality Foundation, Leap Frog, AQA, University HealthSystem Consortium, Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, and the Commonwealth Fund.  \\nCost (C) — the denominator — encompasses the cost of care 2. over time. Regional \\nMedicare spending data from Medicare itself or from the Dartmouth Atlas of \\nHealthcare could provide the information necessary to round out the equation.\\nProviders would then experience payment repercussions based upon their value scores. Over time, we believe that providers would change their behaviors — sharing information, eliminating unnecessary tests — in order to increase quality and decrease costs because payment would be affected by it. \\nThe value index can be constructed for many types of payment models, including hospital \\nDRG payments, physician fees, payment updates and other payment formulas, including bundled payments. \\n2. Bundled payments for high-cost conditions, such as total knee replacement, heart \\nattack and lumbar disc herniation\\nTo realize cost savings quickly, Medicare should start with bundled payments for a limited \\nnumber of high-cost hospital episodes. (Over time, bundled payments could be considered for some chronic conditions as well.) The goal is to reduce practice variation and focus on an outcome-based goal.  \\nThe bundled payment might include hospitalization (Part A), physician (Part B) and post-\\nacute care (nursing home, home health care, etc.) services.  The outcome would be defined as reasonably attainable improvement in health status in the safest, most cost-effective way and would cover the entire episode of care through the patient’s return to function.   \\nSuch a reformed payment model would encourage improved coordination of care among \\nphysicians, hospitals and nursing homes, and it would encourage utilization of nursing and other non-physician caregivers.  It would be important to allow providers time to \\nprepare for this method of reimbursement because many don’t currently participate in organized delivery systems.\\n3. Value-based care demonstration project\\nA longer term recommendation is to develop and implement national value-based care \\ndemonstration projects. These pilots will help us determine which organizational structures and payment methods will drive quality, affordable care. \\nDetailed Recommendations – Insurance for All\\nThe current private health insurance system must be reformed. We agree with the direction of \\nthe following proposal from Len Nichols and John Bertko of the New America Foundation:\\nRequire Americans to purchase health insurance\\uf0a7\\t\\nProvide sliding-scale subsidies to help those in need to buy the insurance\\uf0a7\\t\\nProhibit pre-existing condition exclusions\\uf0a7\\t\\nDefine a minimum health benefit package or actuarial equivalent\\uf0a7\\t\\nAdjust risk-levels among enrollees\\uf0a7\\t\\nWithin the context of a reformed insurance system, we recommend that the government create a simple coordinating mechanism for individuals to select a basic private insurance plan from several options — perhaps modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP).  Let’s give the American people the same insurance options that members of Congress enjoy. We do not support the creation of another government-run, government price-controlled, Medicare-like insurance plan. Medicare pays for volume, not value, causes significant cost-shifts to the private sector and is financially unsustainable. \\nOperational Framework\\nTo carry out some of these functions, we may need to move them a step away from the direct \\ninfluence of lobbyists and special interests.
